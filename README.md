# TRICK 2022 (Returns)

## Goals of the TRICK

* To write the most Transcendental, Imbroglio Ruby program.
* To illustrate some of the subtleties (and design issues) of Ruby.
* To show the robustness and portability of Ruby interpreters.
* To stabilize the spec of Ruby by the presence of valuable but unmaintainable code.

## Rules

These rules are tentative.

1. Your entry must be a complete Ruby program.
1. The size of your program must be <= 4096 bytes in length. The number of non-space characters must be <= 2048. The total size of your compressed submission must be less than ten megabyte in size.
1. You can submit multiple entries, and your team may consist of any number of members.
1. The entirety of your entry must be submitted under [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
1. Your entry must bring the judges a surprise, excitement, and/or laughter.

## Guidelines

These are not strict rules but hints or suggestions. You can ignore them but we'd recommend you to follow them.

* Matz Ruby Implementation (MRI) 3.1 is recommended.
* You can use implementations other than MRI, such as JRuby and Rubinius.
* The judges would prefer more stoic, more portable, and/or more funny entries.
* You are encouraged to study the winners of [previous TRICK contests](https://github.com/tric/).
* You can use a gem library.
  * Note that we will expect such entries to be much more interesting than an entry that uses no library; hence we will judge them strictly.
  * It is highly discouraged to abuse gem to get around the size limit.
* To judge without bias, we will try to keep each entry anonymous during judgment. Do not include anything that reveal your identity (such as a signature, copyright, URL, etc.) in your program.
