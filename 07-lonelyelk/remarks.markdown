## Remarks

Run program to see its full form. Cut its head or tail to make it evolve.

```shell

## Version

It was built using `ruby 3.1.1p18 (2022-02-18 revision 53f5fc4236) [x86_64-darwin19]`

## Details

* It expects default `head` or `tail` to cut 10 lines.
* It is limited to reaction-diffusion patterns that I personally find beautiful that is from
  theta (θ) to kappa (κ) according to Pearson's classification
